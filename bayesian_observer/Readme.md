Run the Jupyter notebook syntheticDataFit.ipynb
This notebook generate synthetic data and run the fitting procedure decribed in Section 4.4 of the associated paper.

The files fit0*****.py is the core code for fitting the data.
The files BSfit0*****.py is the parametric bootstrapping used to compute error bars of the fit.

Aconst indicate that the model assumes a constant log-prior slope.
Alin indicate that the model assumes an affine log-prior slope.
No indication means no assumption.
